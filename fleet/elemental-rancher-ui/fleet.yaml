  ### These options control how "fleet apply" downloads the chart
  #
  # Use a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL or
  # OCI registry based helm chart URL e.g. "oci://ghcr.io/fleetrepoci/guestbook".
  # This allows one to download charts from most any location.  Also know that
  # go-getter URL supports adding a digest to validate the download. If repo
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup.
  # It is possible to download the chart from a Git repository, e.g.
  # by using `git@github.com:rancher/fleet-examples//single-cluster/helm`. If a
  # secret for the SSH key was defined in the GitRepo via `helmSecretName`, it
  # will be injected into the chart URL.
  # Git repositories can be downloaded via unauthenticated http, by using for example:
  # `git::http://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples//single-cluster/helm`.
  chart: git@github.com:rancher/ui-plugin-charts//charts/elemental
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.
